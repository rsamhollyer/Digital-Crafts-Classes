/* URL is directed by using Domain Name Service (DNS)
If we go to www.google.com - our computer requests from the main server where the IP address is for the website. It then goes to IP address and downloadn the content.

This is why un-real domains take you to ATT sites, or whatever your interent servicers defaul to - it's the default for not being able to find that page.

Routers supply DNS service for you. You can change your DNS. You can keep your router from accesssing certain addresses.
Your local machine has a local numer 127.0.0.1 which is you or Local Host.
