# Warmup!


1. Suppose you have an express app that serves a page that shows a list of pet names.
Draw a diagram showing the Request/Response cycle.

2. On the diagram, show which parts are the Model, View, and Controller.

3. In JavaScript, write an example of the kind of data that is in the Model layer.

4. In HTML, write an example of how that data is formatted for the View.

5. In JavaScript, write a function that converts your example Model data into your example View format.
