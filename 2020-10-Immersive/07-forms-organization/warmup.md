Note: any warmup or exercise that says "write a function" really means "write a function as well as any helper functions"

# 1. Colors

Use the `colors.json` file for this exercise.

Write a function that accepts an array as an argument and returns a new array that contains values matching `'orange'`.

Modify your array so that it accepts a String as the second argument. Instead of returning an array that only contains `'orange'` values, return an array of values that match the String argument.

# 2. Coffee

Use the `coffee.json` file for this exercise.

Given an array of receipt objects, write a function that returns the total amount spent on `'espresso'`.

Update your function so that it accepts an additional String argument (e.g., 'black coffee') returns the total amount for that kind of order.

# 3. Products

Use the `products.json` file for this exercise.

Write a function that accepts the array as an argument and returns a new array of products that are on sale.
