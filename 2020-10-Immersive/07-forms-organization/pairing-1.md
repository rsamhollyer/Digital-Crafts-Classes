Using code (yours or your partner's) from the warm up, take turns building the following:


# 1. Coffee listing

`/` - shows the total number of orders and the total amount spent
`/orders` - lists the kinds of coffee orders and the totals for each
`/orders/:kind` - shows all the coffee orders matching that kind (e.g., "espresso")

# 2. Product Listing

`/` - shows all products
`/sale` - shows only products on sale
