# Who are your users?

On an e-commerce site, you may only have one kind of user: the customer.

For a social media site, you can imagine several kinds of users:

- business owner promoting their product
- teenager sharing photos
- casual user who posts pictures of his cat

# What does the user want?

Look at the UI (the view) that you analyzed earlier.

What are some things they would want to do on this page?

List those out.

Pair up those goals with your user types. (Not every user wants to use the same features!)


# Why do they want to do them?

For each user+goal statement, say why they want to do that particular task.
