# Hello, Lab!

Do this for each of the lab repos:

- Click the "fork" button in the upper right. This creates a copy of the repo in your GitHub account. 
- Wait until the fork is finished. You'll be redirected to **your copy** of the repo.
- Click the "Code" button to get the git URL.
- In your terminal:
  - `cd` to a directory where you want to create the repo directory.
  - `git clone` your fork. (This creates a new directory with the repo files.)
  - `cd` into the repo directory
  - Run `npm install` to install any dependencies listed in `package.json`
  
The `README.md` will give you further instructions.

# TODO (example)

- [ ] Run `node index.js`
- [ ] Change what the cow says from 'oh hi' to 'helloooooo!'
- [ ] Commit the change with the command `git commit -am 'changed cow text'`
- [ ] Push the change with `git push`
